# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-for-dimension-reduction.
To understand the workinfg of PCA From the scratch 
Steps:
1. Generating the sample data
2. Computing the mean vector
3. Generating the scatter matrix
4. Computing eigen vectors and values
5. Checking if Eigen vectors are correct
6. Making a list of (eigenvalue,eigenvector) tuples
7. Sort tuples from high to low according to eigen values
8. Now we print the eigenvector corresponding to the highest eigenvalue
9. Transform the data space into one dimension
